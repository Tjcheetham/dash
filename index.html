            <p>
                My name's TJ and I'm from Montana! My wife and I moved to Arizona 4 years ago and we love it! I've
                always
                been a fan of the heat and my wife is getting used to it. Ha!

                <br><br>

                I'm a big fan of pretty much all sports but I specifically enjoy playing basketball, golf, and sand
                volleyball. I follow NFL football pretty closely where I enjoy beating my friends in fantasy football. I
                also apparantly have masochistic tendencies as I am a big fan of the Dallas Cowboys.

                <br><br>

                To throw a curve ball in to the whole thing, I swam competitively for almost 10 years and parlayed that
                into
                my current career as the South Lead Age Group Coach & Site Director for Scottsdale Aquatic Club (SAC). I
                teach primarily 12 & Unders and really enjoy what I do!
